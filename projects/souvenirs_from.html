The Common Denominator
<br><br>
They are bright. They are cheap. They are new. They are clichèes. Sometimes
they are kitsch, Sometimes they are primitive. They are everywhere. They are
found wherever tourists are to be found. They bear the names of places. They
are normally small, so you can buy them quickly, without thinking about
their weight. They can be made by hand. Sometimes they are of poor quality;
sometimes they convey a political message. They are designed commercially,
they are meant to catch the customer's eye. They are supposed to shine, and
be objects of curiosity and beauty. They are finally placed on a desk, a
shelf, a window sill, or in a car. They are prepared to be put up, hung up,
attached to something, pocketed and set alight - or to set things alight.
They are for writing, erasing, opening and plugging in. They are made to
take in other things. They are conventional. They bear the landmark of a
place, a town, a country. Some are functional, some are useful. They are
instruments. They are propaganda. They are cherished. They are thrown out.
They are taken from one place to another, sometimes quite a long distance.
They are minicopies, memories of a trip, a stay somewhere, a moment. They
come from a home, which they want to mirror, into a strange land: fragments
of memory, chunks of yearning, signs of history, evidence of existence,
knick-knacks.
